  <p>As per the Instruction two animations were used in this website.</p>
		<h2>Animation 1</h2>
			<div>CSS Animation 1</div>
			<p>I have applied the animation, where the background colour of the header will change for every 25%.
            I have created an animation element called effects and called it using the keyframes at-rule, where I have written the CSS rules for background-color,
			height, width, timeperiod etc. I then described the keyframes at-rule from the animation class.</p>
			<p>A few animation properties were also defined from the animation class. I have used the short-hand method in the css. They are as follows:</p>
			<p>animation-name: declares the name of the @keyframes at-rule to manipulate.<br />
			animation-duration: the length of time it takes for an animation to complete one cycle.<br />
			animation-timing-function: establishes preset acceleration curves such as ease or linear.<br />
			animation-direction: sets the direction of the animation after the cycle. Its default resets on each cycle.<br />
			animation-play-state: pause/play the animation.<br />
			animation-iteration-count: the number of times the animation should be performed.</p>
			<p>The links for where the Animation 1 implemented in the other webpages is as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="index.html#eff1">First Animation effects in Index</a>
				<li><a href="hometown.html#eff1">First Animation effects in hometown</a>
				<li><a href="quiz.html#eff1">First Animation effects in quiz</a>
			</ul>
		<br />
		<h2>Animation 2</h2>
			<div class="animation2">CSS Animation 2</div>
			<p>I have implemented a repeat text animation to a division on all the WebPages.
			Similar to Animation 1, Here also I have created an animation element and defined @keyframes at-rule, where I have provided the CSS elements with margin and width.
			I then called the @keyframes rule from the animation class.</p>
			<p>From the Animation class I have also created few animation properties. They are as follows:</p>
			<p>animation-name: declares the name of the @keyframes at-rule to manipulate.<br />
			animation-duration: the length of time it takes for an animation to complete one cycle.<br />
			animation-timing-function: establishes preset acceleration curves such as ease or linear.<br />
			animation-direction: sets the direction of the animation after the cycle. Its default resets on each cycle.<br />
			animation-iteration-count: the number of times the animation should be performed.</p>
			<p>The links for where the Animation 2 implemented in the other webpages is as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="index.html#eff2">Second Animation effects in Index</a>
				<li><a href="hometown.html#eff2">Second Animation effects in hometown</a>
				<li><a href="quiz.html#eff2">Second Animation effects in quiz</a>
			</ul>
